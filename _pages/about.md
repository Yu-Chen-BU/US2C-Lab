We are the Intelligent and Sustainable Edge Computing (I-SEC) Laboratory at Binghamton University, supervised by Dr. Yu Chen, a Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Envisioning the next generation of intelligent IoT technologies, our research interests focus on Trust, Security, and Privacy in the Edge-Fog-Cloud Computing paradigm, the Internet of Things (IoT), and their applications in intelligent and connected environments. 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
